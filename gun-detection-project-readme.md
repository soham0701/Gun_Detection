# Advanced Weapon Detection System

![Gun Detection Demo](usecase.png) 

## Overview

This project implements a deep learning-based gun detection system using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm. The model is trained on a dataset of firearm images to accurately identify guns in real-time, making it suitable for security and surveillance applications.

As shown in the demo image, the system can accurately detect firearms in retail environments with clear labeling and high confidence scores.

## üîë Key Features

- **Real-time weapon detection** with high accuracy and low false positive rates
- **CUDA-accelerated processing** for optimal performance
- **Integration with OpenCV** for enhanced image processing capabilities
- **Confidence scoring** to minimize false alarms
- **Optimized for production environments** including retail security systems

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **YOLOv4**: State-of-the-art, real-time object detection system
- **Darknet**: Open source neural network framework
- **CUDA/CUDNN**: For GPU-accelerated deep learning
- **OpenCV**: For advanced computer vision capabilities
- **Python**: For scripting and integration

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weapon-detection-system.git

# Enter the directory
cd weapon-detection-system

# Build Darknet with GPU, CUDA, and OpenCV support
make
```

## üìù Usage

```python
# Example detection script
./darknet detector test data/obj.data cfg/yolov4-custom.cfg weights/yolov4-custom_best.weights path/to/image.jpg
```

## üß† Model Training

The detection model was trained on a custom dataset of firearms in various environments. The training process involved:

1. Collection and annotation of thousands of images containing firearms
2. Data augmentation to increase training set diversity
3. Transfer learning from pre-trained YOLOv4 weights
4. Fine-tuning with custom parameters for weapon detection
5. Validation against real-world scenarios

## üìä Performance Metrics

| Metric              | Value  |
